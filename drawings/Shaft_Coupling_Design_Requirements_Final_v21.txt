- Inner Bore Diameter (Driven End): 28.0 ± 0.025 mm
- Keyway (Drive End): 8.0 × 4.0 × 25.0 mm (Width × Depth × Length)
- Keyway (Driven End): 7.0 × 3.5 × 25.0 mm (Width × Depth × Length)
- Mounting Holes: 6 × M6 threaded holes equally spaced on Ø55.0 mm bolt circle
- Set Screw Holes: 4 × M8 threaded holes (2 per side, 90° offset)
- Flange Thickness: 12.0 ± 0.05 mm (each end)
- Center Section Thickness: 51.0 ± 0.1 mm

==== TOLERANCE SPECIFICATIONS ====
- Concentricity between Inner Bores: 0.01 mm
- Perpendicularity of Flange Face to Bore: 0.015 mm

- Surface Finish of Inner Bores: Ra 0.8 µm
- Surface Finish of Outer Diameter: Ra 1.6 µm
- Surface Finish of Flange Faces: Ra 3.2 µm
- Thread Class for Threaded Holes: 6H

==== MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS ====
- Base Material: AISI 4140 Alloy Steel (Alternative options may be proposed)
- Heat Treatment: Quench and tempered to 28-32 HRC
- Hardness of Bore Surfaces: 58-62 HRC (case hardened)
- Corrosion Protection: Black oxide coating

==== LOAD REQUIREMENTS ====
- Maximum Torque Transmission: 1,500 N·m
- Maximum Speed: 3,000 RPM
- Maximum Misalignment Tolerance: 0.05 mm
- Operating Temperature Range: -20°C to +120°C
- Environment: Industrial, moderate exposure to lubricants and coolants

==== SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS ====
- Balancing: Dynamic balancing to ISO 1940 G6.3
- Fatigue Life: Minimum 10⁷ cycles at 75% of maximum torque
- Keyways must be manufactured to DIN 6885-1 standard
- All sharp edges to be broken with 0.5 mm maximum radius
- Part must be marked with part number, material, and lot number
- 100% visual inspection required before shipping
- Material certification required

==== CRITICAL DIMENSIONS ====
The following dimensions are critical to part function:
- Inner bore diameters and their tolerances
- Concentricity between bores
- Parallelism between flanges
- Keyway dimensions and positioning

==== MANUFACTURING NOTES ====
1. Keyways to be machined after heat treatment and grinding of bores
2. Threaded holes to be machined before heat treatment
3. Final grinding of bores to be performed after heat treatment and stress relief
4. Balancing to be performed after all machining operations are complete
5. Inspect critical dimensions using CMM and record results

==== QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS ====
- First Article Inspection (FAI) per AS9102
- Material certification must be provided
- Hardness test results must be documented
- CMM inspection report for critical dimensions
- Surface finish measurement report

==== ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ====
This shaft coupling is designed for precision power transmission in industrial mixing equipment. The application requires high-torque capacity, dimensional stability, and long service life. The design allows for minimal misalignment while maintaining zero backlash during operation.
