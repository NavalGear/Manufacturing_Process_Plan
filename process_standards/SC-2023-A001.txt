     * Use proper tapping fluid
     * Check alignment in the setup
   
   - Heat Treatment Distortion:

     * Consider stress relief before final machining
     * Allow for distortion in pre-heat treatment dimensions

2. PROCESS-SPECIFIC CHALLENGES:
   - Turning Chatter:
     * Reduce overhang of boring bars
     * Increase rigidity of workholding
     * Adjust cutting parameters
   
   - Milling Vibration:
     * Use shorter, more rigid tooling
